        <li>Turn the stove down to medium-low heat and pour in the whisked eggs and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
            Allow it to cook fir 1-2 min until the bottom starts to set then pull up the edges of the eggs and let the eggs run underneath.
            Add the cubed cream cheese and continue to cook for another 1-2 min until the cheese melts and the eggs are just barely cooked 
            and very soft. Remove from the heat. <em>12 large eggs, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 oz cream cheese</em>

        </li>
        <li>To assemble the burritos, warm tortillas individually in for 20 sec in the microwave or char over the open gas flame
            for a few seconds on each side, until soft and pliable. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on the bottom of the tortilla then 
            add black beans, eggs, and cooked sausage. <em>6 large tortillas, 6-8 oz shredded cheddar cheese, 1 (15oz) can of black beans</em>
        </li>
        <li>Fold the tortilla over the filling, fold in each side, and continue rolling forward. Side-ends of the tortillas over filling and roll forward.
            Wrap the tortillas in foil and bake for 8-10 min, until heated through and the cheese is melted.
