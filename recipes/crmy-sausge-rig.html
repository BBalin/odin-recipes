    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>15 oz Italian sausage crumbled</li>
        <li>8 oz rigatoni uncooked</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>15 oz tomato sauce</li>
        <li>5 oz fresh spinach</li>
        <li>salt and coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil on medium heat in a large, hish-sided, heavy bottomed skillet on the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Add crumbled sausage and cook on medium heat for about 5min, crumbling it, until it is cooked through.
            Drain any grease or liquid.
        </li>
        <li>To the same skillet with sausage, add uncooked rigatoni, chicken broth, heavy cream, minced garlic, 
            Italian seasoning, and tomato sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil on medium heat and stir everything well. Cover with a lid and allow the pasta to cook 
            for about 10 to 15 min on medium heat, while the sauce boils.</li>
        <li>Cook until pasta reaches an "al dente" texture. Stir frequently to prevent the pasta and sausage from sticking to 
            the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Add fresh spinach, and cook on medium heat, stirring frequently for a couple minutes, until the spinach 
            wilts to your liking.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, just remove the skillet from heat, top sausage rigatoni with spinach, cover the pan with the lid.
            Let the spinach wilt, off heat, in the residual heatfor about 4 min. Then, stir.
        </li>
        <li>Cook longer if you would like a thicker sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well. Remove from heat. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and red pepper flakes if you like.</li>
    </ol>
